    <td>I learnt by listening to Mr Keen when he showed us how he had done his, and I also found that using http://www.w3schools.com/was extremely helpful, it had lots of code that I could use!</td>

    <td>In this particular lesson, nothing limited my learning because I completed all tasks confidently and I even got onto more complicated things.</td>
