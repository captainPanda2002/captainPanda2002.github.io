    <td>This lesson, we had the hour to improve our blog. Last lesson, we looked at other blogs for inspiration and I really liked the idea of having pictures on the home screen. So, I spent the hour figuring out and asking my peers about how to do it. This deemed extremely effective and I'm very proud of how my website looks.</td>
