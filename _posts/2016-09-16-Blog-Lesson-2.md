  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by doing exactly what we were told to, I made an avatar for my page and I also put a background on it and changed the font. The listening and copying strategy was very effective. </td>

    <td>I would say I was scared to do anything especially extensive because I was afraid to muck up the site.</td>

    <td>Next time, maybe go a step further and perhaps make it more complicated therefore making it a better outcome should it work. </td>
