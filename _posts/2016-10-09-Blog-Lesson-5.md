  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by asking for help and putting that into my own way of understanding. I learnt that Variable names are abbreviated such as JFK to avoid typos and to save time. I learnt more about spreadsheets and I also worked on my blog style.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on being more collaborative and maybe helping others out a little more rather than just sit there when I've completed the set task. Nothing limited my learning.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time, nothing needs to be changed - I donâ€™t see any reason to improve from what I did this lesson.</td>
