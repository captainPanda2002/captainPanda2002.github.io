    <td>Mr Keen told us all to gather round and basically listen for the majority of the lesson. Mr Tansley's class came in to listen as well. We all learnt by just listening and taking in what we were expected to do. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Because there were so many of us in the room, the prospect of incessant talking was slightly inevitable. We were all given a detention for this so this definitely limited all of our learning. As a group, we all need to work on listening habits. </td>

    <td>Next time, I'd like to take some time in the lesson to actually work on my blog and ideally not be told to come back on Monday lunchtime. </td>
