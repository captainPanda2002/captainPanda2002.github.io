    <td>This week, I stayed focused and nothing limited my learning. Perhaps if I had sped up a bit then I could’ve got more done but I’m still happy with what I achieved.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will remain focused, just like I did in this lesson. This will improve my learning. I am very aware of the fact that these third boxes are fairly brief, however, I do genuinely just need to keep this up and use the same learning habits I have been using all along. </td>
